    "This course introduces computational cognitive modeling for researchers and practitioners in the field of HCI. Cognitive models use computer programs to model how users perceive, think, and act in interactive tasks. They offer a powerful approach for understanding interaction and improving user interfaces. The course starts with a review of classic models such as Fitts's Law, GOMS and ACT-R. It builds on this review to provide an introduction to modern modelling approaches powered by machine learning methods, in particular deep learning, reinforcement learning (RL), and deep RL. The course is built around hands-on Python programming using notebooks.\n",
    "\n",
    "A basic understanding of programming concepts is a prerequisite for this course and some familiarity with Python and Google Colab Notebooks (similar to Jupyter notebooks) is likely to be useful. If you have followed the README instructions on our repo, https://github.com/howesa/CHI22-CogMod-Tutorial, then hopefully you are reading this text having uploaded it to your private Google Colab. This is a good start and it means that the document you are reading is not a static web page but, instead, an interactive environment. The key property of this environment is that it lets you write and execute code interactively. \n",
    "\n",
    "We will illustrate interactive code execution in the remainder of this notebook and as we do so we will also review some of the historically important ideas in cognitive modelling for HCI. If you are familiar with notebooks, Python and with Fitts's Law, GOMS, ACT-R and EPIC then you may want to skip the remainder of the current notebook and move to the first module.\n",

    "<p style='margin-left:1em;'>Fitts's Law has proved highly influential in HCI since it was used by Card, English and Burr (1978) to compare various input devices. There are many research papers that describe more recent developments of the law, its application, and a number of limitations. One limitation is the fact that the law says nothing about speed/accuracy trade-offs, nor anything about errors. When a person moves a pointer to a target, they can choose whether to move quickly or slowly. If they choose to move quickly then the chance that they will make an error will increase. This is a topic that we will return to later in the tutorial when we look at reinforcement learning models of cognition. In these models, a reward function determines the desired speed/accuracy trade-off function and predictions of movement time emerge through learning an optimal policy for the reward function. The ability to model speed/accuracy trade-offs is critical to the scientific understanding of HCI because of the adaptive nature of human cognition.\n",

    "\n",
    "GOMS was a 1980s approach to cognitive modeling in Human-Computer Interaction in which human skill for computing systems was represented in terms of goals, operators, methods and selection rules. Many other methods for modeling task knowledge were based on similar concepts and GOMS gave rise to many variants through the 1980s and in to the 2000s. Though their meanings have been refined, these concepts remain useful today, and it is worth briefly reviewing them. \n",
    "\n",
    "Goals are what the user has to accomplish and represent the end towards which the user is directed. Example goals might include making a set of changes to a text document or replying to an email.  Goals typically have subgoals giving rise to the hierarchical structure of skill. For example, the goal of correcting the typos in a text might have as subgoals to \"delete text\" and \"insert word\". \n",
    "\n",
    "Operators model what a user can do in service of a goal. Operators may be theories of how a user makes changes to the external environment or they may be theories of mental operators that, for example, update memory. The very lowest level of operator could be indiviudal muscle axon innervations but cognitive models typically define operators at a much higher level than this. For example, a cognitive model of form filling might define operators at the word entry level, whereas a cognitive model of typing might define operators at a character level. \n",

    "Methods are sequences of subgoals and operators that achieve specific goals. For example, the goal of entering a name into a form might be accomplished with methods that we can represent with Python functions."

    "The difference between a goal and an operator in GOMS is that operators are not broken down any further; they are at the bottom of a hierarchy of subgoals. Card, Moran and Newell demonstrated GOMS models at 4 levels of analysis. At one level the operators represented tasks taking about 30 seconds, at another the operators represented single keystrokes. As with Fitts's Law, the idea was that GOMS could be used to predict human performance time by adding up the durations of the sequence of operators required to achieve a goal. \n",
