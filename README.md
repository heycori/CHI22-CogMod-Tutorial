# CogMod-Tutorial

CogMod-Tutorial is a set of Python Jupyter Notebooks designed as an introduction to cognitive, neural and RL modeling in Human-Computer Interaction. 

Designed for delivery at CHI 2022 by Jussi Jokinen, Antti Oulasvirta and Andrew Howes with thanks to Xiuli Chen.

Before starting the tutorial it is worth knowing a little about the Python programming language and also about Jupyter Notebooks. 

The notebooks for the tutorial will be made available in this GitHub repository on 26th April 2022. If you are attending the tutorial then -- before this date -- you should read the contents of the file getting_started.ipynb.

If you click on getting_started.ipynb in the GitHub repository (above) then at the top of the document you will see a button that says "Open in Colab". Click on this button and read the document.
